## What is Vibe-Coding?
This project follows the vibe-coding philosophy‚Äîwhere code is an extension of personal style and intuition. Every design and component is crafted based on vibes, resulting in a site that feels uniquely yours.

### Development Approach
- **Primary Development:** Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Quality Assurance & Debugging:** Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- **Development Environment:** Cursor IDE for seamless AI integration

---

## Tech Stack
- **Static Site Generator:** Eleventy (for the ultimate vibe)
- **Templating:** Nunjucks
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (utility-first, retro vibes)
- **Content:** Markdown + JSON data files

### Why JSON Data Files?
Using JSON (`.json`) for data management keeps things simple, structured, and easy to update. All site-wide info, author details, and social/contact links live in `src/_data/site.json`‚Äîedit once, update everywhere. This aligns with the vibe-coding philosophy: maximum flexibility, minimal fuss.
